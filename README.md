# Trivia Training App

This is a trivia training web application for the Code Challenge project for the Software Engeineer Apprenticeship program at Tandem. 

## Goal

The goal is to create an trivia application that displays questions with multiple-choice answers to choose from.

### Assumptions
- A round of trivia has 10 questions
- All questions are multiple-choice questions
- The score does not need to update in real time
- Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
- Trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers is provided in a JSON file

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Accptance Criteria
- A user can view questions
- Questions with their multiple choice options much be displayed one at a time
- Questions should not repeat in a round
- A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers
- The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
- A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Instruction to run the app
1. Clone this git repo to your local machine.
2. Cd into the directory and run npm install.
3. Type in npm start in your terminal to run the app.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
